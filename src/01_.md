# Chapter 1: Introduction
Welcome to the Rust Gamedev Extended tutorial (TODO)! 

## Why Rust?
I started learning Rust in 2019 and I've been making a game in Rust since. I've learnt a lot in the process about Rust, about making games, written a bunch of blog posts about it and learnt a lot about the Rust gamedev ecosystem. This book is largely me putting all my experience down on "paper" in a structured format and hoping it will attract more people to Rust and the Rust gamedev community.

## What is this book about?
In this book we are going to be making a [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) copy in Rust using one of the existing Rust game engines ([ggez](https://ggez.rs/)). We'll also be doing some minimal pixel art (although feel free to just rip off my assets if you prefer to stay away from the artistic craft) and basic game design.

Give me a shout if you liked this book or if you'd like to contribute somehow and please consider sponsoring [the book](TODO) on github, that will allow me to dedicate more time to it.

## Do I need to know Rust to follow this book?
No! I want this book to be accessible to everyone and to be a good intro for people that don't know Rust. Just bear in mind this is a pretty hands on tutorial and it will not by any means cover all the language, but it should be a good way for you to get your hands dirty and write some Rust. The only suggestion I'll make is that you take it step by step, follow the instructions and if there are concepts you don't understand and they are not explained in the book, go and try to find out more. This book is not meant to be an in depth walkthrough of all of Rust's features, just a gentle introduction to the language doing a fun little task.

However, if you find yourself in need of help or just want to ask a question, here are some good places to start with:
* [The Rust programming language book](https://amzn.to/2tXzRdP)
* [Rust learning by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
* [Rust in motion course](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/rust-in-motion?a_aid=cnichols&a_bid=6a993c2e)
* [r/rust](http://reddit.com/r/rust)
* [r/rustgamedev](http://reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev)

One of the best things about Rust are the people behind it. There is an amazing community out there so please feel encouraged to reach out to any of us.

Alright, now that we got the intro out of the way, let's create our first Rust project and write some code!
